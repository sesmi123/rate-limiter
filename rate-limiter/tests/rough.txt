
Token bucket
=================================================================================

Token bucket should have capacity, refill rate

Token bucket should be initialised with full capacity 

Token bucket should be refilled with tokens after refill rate 

Test bucket does not go over set capacity

If bucket is full, refill should overflow

Request should be processed if there is token available and reduce the count

Request should be denied if there are no tokens 

Test behavior under concurrent access
